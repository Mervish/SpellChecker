As far as I am able to judge after long attending to the subject the conditions of life appear to act in two ways—directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system With respect to the direct action we must bear in mind that in every case as Professor Weismann has lately insisted and as I have incidentally shown in my work on Variation under Domestication there are two factors namely the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions The former seems to be much the more important for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under as far as we can judge dissimilar conditions and on the other hand dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform The effects on the offspring are either definite or indefinite They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner
